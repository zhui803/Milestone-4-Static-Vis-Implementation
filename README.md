# Milestone-4-Static-Vis-Implementation

Greetings,

I have hosted my webpage on GitHub. If you wish to run my code locally, you can access it via the following link: https://zhui803.github.io/. The webpage ratio for viewing the content will be 33% (I believe it is the default of Google Chrome)

All static elements in the best practices for the design of the system have been implemented. The infusion of the line graph into the map representation when hover over specific country is scheduled to be implemernted in the next stage considering the level of interactivity of this feature (eg. hover actions, pop-up window, manual selection).

In response to the feedback provided for M3, I'm working on guiding users through the main points and highlights of my revised poem. I've made further updates to the poem and uploaded the latest version on Canvas. After discussions with W.J., the poem has been enhanced to transcend a dialogue between a daughter and her mother. It now represents a daughter's connection with all the women globally who have uplifted, inspired, and supported her through an unseen tapestry woven over the years.

Lastly, I've opted to remove the multiple line charts from sheet 4 (brainstorm 2) of M3 due to their inability in allowing for country comparisons. Instead, I'll be emphasizing country comparisons using varying color shades (already successfully implemented in this mileston), which I believe will provide a more intuitive user experience.

Thank you once again for your feedback and guidance.

Chloe
